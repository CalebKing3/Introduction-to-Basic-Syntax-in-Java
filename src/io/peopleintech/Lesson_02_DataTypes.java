    /*
    There are two broad categories of data types in Java:
    ? 1. Primitive types
    ? 2. Objects/Reference types.

    Primitive types are the basic data types that store simple data and form the foundation of data manipulation.
    For example, Java has primitive types for

     ! - integer values (int, long, byte, short), 2,3,4
     ! - floating-point values (float and double), 20.00
     ! - character values (char) 'C'
     ! - logical values (boolean). true/false

    On the other hand, reference types are objects that contain references to values and/or other objects,
    or to the special value null to denote the absence of value.
